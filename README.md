# Personal-Book-Library

ðŸš€ Just Built a Simple Personal Book Library Using HTML, CSS & JavaScript!

Check out this clean, front-end-only project to organize your book collection! Here's what's under the hood:

ðŸ“Œ Features:

Search Functionality: Instantly filter books by title using the search bar.

Responsive Design: Mobile-friendly layout with a modern, shadowed container.

Stylish Table: Alternating row colors, hover effects, and clean borders for readability.

Static Data: Sample books included (shoutout to The Great Gatsby and Atomic Habits!).

ðŸ’» Tech Stack:

HTML for structure.

CSS for styling (flexible container, gradients, shadows).

Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic search filtering.

Perfect for beginners to explore DOM manipulation and CSS styling! What features would you add next? A form to add new books? LocalStorage persistence?
